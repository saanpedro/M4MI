<h4>a3</h4>
<p>For A3 I used Erased, before reading the brief I had already imagined a dream like soundscape for this one, this peace is comprised mostly of pads and one arpeggiator.
at 0:12 I used a tremolo effect on the arpeggiator to convey the shift in camera and the addition of film overlaying giving it a slightly disorientating feel, at 0:29 I started to add more reverb as the camera turned attention from the the main actor to give a feel for the emptiness with out him, at 0:50 onwards a added a slight bit of bit crush along with some dissonant notes to show the fear and mood change in the video.</p>
<h5>a4</h5>
<p>For A4 Alive: rules of the sea, I went for a more ambient sound tracking rather than a rhythmic one as I felt this matched the theme of deep sea microorganisms. I used 4 different synth sounds for this, I also made ambient changes when entering caves and exiting them. The main synth is an arpeggiator that I made end on the same note at the end of each bar, I then put a fair amount of reverb on this to try and make it sound like a submarine sonar blip.</p>
