<p>For A4 Alive: rules of the sea, I went for a more ambient sound track rather than a rhythmic one as I felt this matched the theme of deep sea microorganisms. I used 4 different synth sounds for this, I also made ambient changes when entering caves and exiting them. The main synth is an arpeggiator that I made end on the same note at the end of each bar, I then put a fair amount of reverb on this to try and make it sound like a submarine sonar blip.</p>
